Notes:
 - I attempted to create a graph of the population over time to better visualize the change.
 - The program lags when attempting to run on a larger population, say 5000 people. I guess its because of the number of computations it has to make.
I would however appreciate a better way to implement it and make it time efficient
 - Interesting project. Took me almost a week to understand what I was supposed to do and how to go about it
