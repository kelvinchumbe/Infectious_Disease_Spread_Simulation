# Infectious_Disease_Spread_Simulation
This is a simple infectious disease spread simulation using the **SIR model** (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered).
Input the required parameters that define the disease, population demographic and days to run the simulation then start the simulation to see how the infection is modelled throughout the population
